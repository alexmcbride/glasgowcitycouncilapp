                "To exhibit in Scotland's most popular modern art gallery is an ambition held by many, but achieved by only a few.  A group of pupils from Hollybrook Academy, a school for children with additional support needs, will join this select group of artists, as they will curate and open their own exhibition at GoMA.  The exhibition is called Scribbles by Hollybrook, it opens on Friday 13th May and runs until Sunday 29th May 2016.\n\n" +
                "In 2014 the school established a Social Enterprise company called Scribbles by Hollybrook. The purpose of this Social Enterprise is to frame and sell pupils' artwork, with all profits raised donated to Glasgow Children's Hospital, where most of the pupils involved have been treated at some stage in their lives.\n\n" +
                "Glasgow Museums will introduce the young people who are part of Scribbles by Hollybrook to the many different roles that make up the wider creative industries sector.  A project team consisting of pupils and museums staff will select pupils artwork for display, design the exhibition layout, draft interpretation panels to accompany the artwork, plan the logistics and take part in the set up and promote the display.  The overall ambition is that the Business Studies students may be able to work towards achieving an SQA in Creative Industries.\n" +
                "Victor Cannon, Teacher of Business Education and ICT, at Hollybrook Academy said: \"Scribbles has gone from strength to strength since it started in 2014.  Glasgow Museums helped get the social enterprise up and running, so it's wonderful to be able to show off some of the fruits of the project in GoMA no less. \n\n" +
                "The children have learned so much about the different jobs which make up the creative industries and of course they are chuffed to bits to have their artwork hanging in Scotland's most visited art gallery.  We hope lots of people will come and see the show and maybe even pick a piece of art of take home at the end of it.  The children see it as an opportunity to give something back to Yorkhill.\"\n\n" +
                "The project has received tremendous community backing.  After hosting an exhibition last year at IKEA, the company has continued their support by donating all the frames for the artwork to be exhibited and then sold.  Natasha Rankin, a familiar face on BBC One's Bargain Hunt, has worked with the pupils during the last year and will be guest speaker at the opening of Scribbles by Hollybrook on Friday 13th May.\n\n" +
                "Chair of Glasgow Life, Councillor Archie Graham, said: \"GoMA has hosted many high profile, popular exhibitions, which have often addressed challenging issues through the medium of art.  I think Scribbles by Hollybrook is a worthy addition to the exhibition programme for 2016.  Not only has it been curated and displayed by some very talented young people, many of whom have to deal with a range of challenging issues themselves each day, but because it displays the very work they have created.  I hope the many visitors to GoMA will take time to wander onto the balcony and enjoy the show.");
